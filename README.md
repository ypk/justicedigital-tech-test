# Basic password validation

## Goal
Design and implement some code that validates a password.

The password will be provided by the user (as an argument of the method) and should return if the password is valid or not.

A valid password should meet the following criteria:

- Have more than 8 characters
- Contains a capital letter
- Contains a lowercase
- Contains a number
- Contains an underscore
- If 3 or more criteria fail, the password is invalid.

## Technical requirements:
* We want a method that answers if the password is valid or not.
* We need to know the reason why the password is invalid
