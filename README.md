# Password Validation – Requirements

## Goal
Implement a function or method that checks whether a given password is valid according to specific rules.

## Validation Criteria
A password is considered valid if it meets **all** of the following requirements:
- It has more than 8 characters.
- It contains at least one uppercase letter.
- It contains at least one lowercase letter.
- It contains at least one number.
- It contains at least one underscore (`_`).

## Technical Requirements
- The password will be provided as an argument to the function or method.
- The function should return a boolean or a simple result indicating whether the password is valid.
- The function does **not** need to provide reasons for invalidity—only a valid/invalid result is required.
